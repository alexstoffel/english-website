        <h3>Noah’s Ark</h3>
        <p>After God saw that mankind had become violent and wicked, he decided to cleanse the Earth with a flood. Noah, a righteous man, was instructed to build an ark and preserve pairs of animals. The flood lasted 40 days and nights, after which the world was reborn. <strong>Analysis:</strong> This myth portrays water as both a punishment and a purifying force. Through a psychological lens, the flood represents a reset of the collective unconscious, with Noah as the individuated self.</p>

      <div class="myth-card">
        <h3>Yu the Great</h3>
        <p>Yu's 13-year struggle against the floods shows humanity conquering chaos not by divine rescue, but by wisdom, labor, and self-sacrifice. He channels the water rather than damming it. <strong>Anthropological Insight:</strong> This reflects early Chinese society’s emphasis on order, harmony, and the mandate of heaven. Yu earns power through merit, not birthright.</p>

      <h2>Archetypes & Interpretation</h2>
      <p>According to Joseph Campbell, flood myths mirror the “Belly of the Whale” stage in the Hero’s Journey, where the hero enters the chaos of the unconscious to be reborn.</p>

    <section id="modern">
      <h2>Modern Reflections</h2>
      <p>Today, rising sea levels, climate anxiety, and technological overreach echo the themes of ancient flood myths. Are we, like the ancients, ignoring the signs of the unconscious?</p>

    <section id="personal">
      <h2>My Reflection</h2>
      <p>I’ve experienced my own flood moments—times when I felt overwhelmed by school, expectations, or identity. These myths helped me see that going under doesn’t mean it’s over. It means something new can grow.</p>
